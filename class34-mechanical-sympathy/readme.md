## class 34: Mechanical Sympathy
- term from racecar driving goes back a while
- understand how the car works is better driver and get more out the car
- understand how our machine works
- go is to build in the cloud
- already give up some things: archicure: microservices (overhead of overhead in communication, cost of development and operation)
- code: read it and mantaining
- optimizing? Topdown: architecture, design (algirthm, concurrency, layers of abstractions), implemntation (programming language and how we use memory)
- MEC SYM: implementation level of things
- Hard to do MEC SYM with an interpreted language (vs compiled language), they are designed to abstract away the machine away from you (can't see it)
- Abstaction is expensive
- 2005, processor stopped getting faster, increase in the number of cores, limitations of hardware (keep having more transistors)
- Can't make a chip twice as fast (clock speed perspective) every 18 month
- Gap between performance of CPU and memory
- Keep making CPU faster, we can't do that with memory 
- CPU chip and memory banks in a motherboard. There is a distance d between them
