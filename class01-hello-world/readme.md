- Every program has to have a main function, it tells go where does the program start
- Modular language you can put the program in different files and compile it together
- Put different parts of the program into packages. But the main function has to be in a package main
- We need to import any package we use
- To compiles (it sticks it in some secret temp directory) and run (and then get rid of what left over)
