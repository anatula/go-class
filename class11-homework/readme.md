### Homework: implement countWordsAndImages

Given some HTML as raw text, parse it into a document and then call your counting routine to detect and count words and images.

- don't worry about getting HTML from an HTTP query; we're not there yet.
- We'll copy a snippet of HTML into the program as a raw string
- write the code that's gonna parse that HTML
